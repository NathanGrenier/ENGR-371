# Population and Sample:

Focused on university students aged 20-24 owning electronic devices, ensuring relevance to the study's modern context. This population is apt for examining the effects of device usage on sleep quality.

# Hypothesis:

Suggests a link between extended device use before bedtime and poorer sleep quality. However, you need to consider numbers to test your hypothesis. What "Extended use " and "poorer sleep quality " mean? how you want to measure these?

# Research Summary:

Good.

# Importance of Hypothesis:

Good.

# Sampling Procedure and Data Collection:

Adopts a random sampling method for inclusivity and broad representation. Utilizes an online survey for convenience, aiming to gather self-reported data on screen time and sleep quality. But again, how you quantify sleep quality?

# Sample Size and Independence Check:

Targets a sample size of 50 participants is good.
